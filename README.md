# binder-datasets

These is a custom dataset made using various programs such as LibreOffice and GIMP used for my Jupyter Notebook binders here on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dhorvay) and at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dhorvay/binder/HEAD).

Currently, the dataset is composed of images used for optical character recognition (OCR) for example notebooks of different OCR engines and packages.
